Due to universality, they exactly capture the essential physics of the excluded-volume effect for polymers in the good-solvent limit, and as such can be used to study features such as the value of the Flory exponent $\\nu$ which relates the geometric size of a walk to the number of monomers in the chain.\n\nThe pivot algorithm is the most efficient known method for sampling self-avoiding walks of fixed length. It is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which was invented by Lal\u00a0[@Lal1969MonteCarlocomputer], but first studied in depth by Madras and Sokal\u00a0[@Madras1988PivotAlgorithmHighly], who also invented an efficient hash table implementation. Recent improvements to the implementation of the pivot algorithm\u00a0[@Kennedy2002fasterimplementationpivot; @Clisby2010AccurateEstimateCritical; @Clisby2010Efficientimplementationpivot] have dramatically improved computational efficiency to the point where it is possible to rapidly sample polymer configurations with up to 1 billion monomers\u00a0[@Clisby2018MonteCarlo4dSAWs].\n\nIn this paper, we will describe two recent improvements in algorithms to sample self-avoiding walks, focusing in particular on the pivot algorithm. In Sec.\u00a0\\[sec:offlattice\\] we describe an off-lattice implementation of the pivot algorithm which performs better than the standard lattice-only version; in Sec.\u00a0\\[sec:parallel\\] we describe a parallel implementation.\n\nOff-lattice and parallel implementations of the pivot algorithm\n============================================================\n\n",

Attribute-based features are useful to characterize user\u2019s accounts in OSN, while graph-based features can reveal the dynamics of information dissemination across the network.

  "---\nabstract: 'Preliminary results are presented from a simple, single-antenna experiment designed to measure the all-sky radio spectrum between 100 and 200\u00a0MHz. The system used an internal comparison-switching scheme to reduce non-smooth instrumental contaminants in the measured spectrum to 75\u00a0mK. From the observations, we place an initial upper limit of $450$\u00a0mK on the relative brightness temperature of the redshifted 21\u00a0cm contribution to the spectrum due to neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization, assuming a rapid transition to a fully ionized IGM at a redshift of 8. With refinement, this technique should be able to distinguish between slow and fast reionization scenarios. To constrain the duration of reionization to $\\Delta z>2$, the systematic residuals in the measured spectrum must be reduced to 3\u00a0mK.'\nauthor:\n- 'Judd D. Bowman, Alan E. E.

Hewitt'\ntitle: Toward Empirical Constraints on the Global Redshifted 21 cm Brightness Temperature during the Epoch of Reionization\n---\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThe transition period at the end of the cosmic \u201cDark Ages\u201d is known as the epoch of reionization (EOR). During this epoch, radiation from the very first luminous sources\u2014early stars, galaxies, and quasars\u2014succeeded in ionizing the neutral hydrogen gas that had filled the intergalactic medium (IGM) since the recombination event following the Big Bang. Reionization marks a significant shift in the evolution of the Universe. For the first time, gravitationally-collapsed objects exerted substantial feedback on their environments through electromagnetic radiation, initiating processes that have dominated the evolution of the visible baryonic Universe ever since. The epoch of reionization, therefore, can be considered a dividing line when the relatively simple evolution of the early Universe gave way to more complicated and more interconnected processes. Although the Dark Ages are known to end when the first luminous sources ionized the neutral hydrogen in the IGM, precisely when this occurred was a source of ongoing debate, particularly given the currently accepted age of the universe. The key to reconstructing the history of the IGM during EOR is to measure its redshifted 21cm spectral line as an indirect",
  "---\nabstract: 'While cavity cooling of a single trapped emitter was demonstrated, cooling of many particles in an array of harmonic traps needs investigation and poses a question of scalability. This work investigates the cooling of a one dimensional atomic array to the ground state of motion via the interaction with the single mode field of a high-finesse cavity. The key factor ensuring the cooling is found to be the mechanical inhomogeneity of the traps. Furthermore it is shown that the pumped cavity mode does not only mediate the cooling but also provides the necessary inhomogeneity if its periodicity differs from the one of the array. This configuration results in the ground state cooling of several tens of atoms within a few milliseconds, a timescale compatible with current experimental conditions. Moreover, the cooling rate scaling with the atom number reveals a drastic change of the dynamics with the size of the array: atoms are either cooled independently, or via collective modes. In the latter case the cavity mediated atom interaction destructively slows down the cooling as well as increases the mean occupation number, quadratically with the atom number. Finally, an order of magnitude speed up of the cooling is predicted as an outcome the optimization scheme based on the adjustment of the array versus the cavity mode periodicity.'\naddress: 'Theoretische Physik, Universit\u00e4t des Saarlandes, D-66041 Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany'\nauthor:\n- 'O.S.

The advantage of this system compared to other optomechanical platforms (i.e., micro- and nanometer scale mechanical oscillators) is the access to internal atomic degrees of freedom that can be used to tune the coupling and to manipulate the mechanical modes. The cavity does not only provide tailored photonic interaction between the atoms by virtue of the cavity mode but also a confinement-based trap.\n\nThe interplay between atom and mechanical modes and the resulting mechanically unstable and trapped modes has been recognized since the beginning of the"
