  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \nA valuable member of the imperial family, Emperor Huizong sought to suppress him. Du Fu fled to Huguochang, today's Qiyun county in Guizhou province. Emperor Huizong did not accept his poems as sincere, so he ordered the censor to destroy his poems. After he left, he visited China again, only to be pursued by government officials. He then moved to Hangzhou, today's Xihu county in Hangzhou prefecture, near the city of Shangqiu in Henan province.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not completely clear. Rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms of temnospondyls are defined in terms of the positions of their vertebral elements, not by their exact structures. If we do not define the position of elements by their structures, but by the conditions of their preservation, then we can classify temnospondyls according to the positions of their elements.\nExcluding those two families, we can place the rest of the temnospondyls into three groups, rhachitomous, stereospondylous and transitional. We will see how these three groups of temnospond",
