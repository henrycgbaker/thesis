  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to play any role in the British advance in Burma during 1855. A mobile 10 cm cruiser like the Victor was used to bombard a Napier gun and mortar battery, which were used to shell Chinese positions on the bank of the river.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms was previously unviable based on the polyphyletic nature of the early osteospondyli. Nonetheless, some of the rhachitomous forms were later recognized as distinct suborders, one being the Tarponosaurus, while the stereospondylus and anerogonatid types were not recognized as separate classes. The concept of an aevator form of temnospondyl fishes are referenced, and some other events are outlined.\nPrint Publication Description: Originally temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae.
