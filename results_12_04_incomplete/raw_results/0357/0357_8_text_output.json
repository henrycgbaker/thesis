Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous.\nThe name Edopoidea is derived from the Greek words edo meaning \"to bite\" and pous meaning \"foot\". Edopoids are known as biting temnospondyls because their foot bones are so narrow that the edge of the foot fits tightly against the edge of the jaw. This helps them hold onto prey like insects and insects. In most Edopoids, the eye is small and eyeless and so is more likely to be as an aid to movement in low vegetation, a close approximation to walking or running in this day and age.\n^ \"Fossil Placodermi: Ed",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls.

  " In the fall of 1944, Rifenburg enrolled at the University of Michigan. The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about Rifenburg in September 1944 that opened as follows : \" Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon in the person of Dick Rifenburg, 18 @-@ year @-@ old Michigan freshman. Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can be blessed by the gift of giving each other the gift of love. The poem \u2018On Seeing a Swan\u2019, written by William Wordsworth will explain the following questions: does love exist in life beyond belief? Does it come as a surprise that there is love? Could love find a place in your heart? The poem \u2018The World is Round\u2019, by Elizabeth Bishop is an excellent example of abstract love and a plea for acceptance of the mysteries of life. Could love be confined to the \u2018wrinkles\u2019 on our brow? Are they reminders of our sacred love life? Love is the air we breathe, the food we eat",
