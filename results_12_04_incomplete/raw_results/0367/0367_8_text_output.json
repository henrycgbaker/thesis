The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which in the early days of World War II had participated in Japanese troop movements into and through Japan and which still remained a threat to Japanese control over Korea.\nAs there was no ironclad in use, the British proceeded to refuse permission to Americans and other Europeans to enter or attack Japan, no matter their numbers or their intentions.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylic lateran vertebral column structures is tentative ; genera belonging to the long, conelike articulate, cervicocephalic Stereospondyli may show large or low dorsal foramina, great or few retrobranchial vermitean openings, prominent or nonpronic foramina, and have rudimentary sacral swellings, unlike their long - articulat-ingformers and deeper - facet - bony vehicles ( Verweij & Cope 1996 ).

Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the walls. During the next two days, angry North Korean casualties started pouring in across the Allied line, some reporting friendly fire incidents.\nLet's be clear, the Russians probably underestimated North Korea for their own security, because it would really be pointless to focus on the little fellow in the big boy's game.\nBut North Korea began escalating the terror of getting cut off, with some Koreans venturing across the UN or border to take back the crops that the communists were hoarding away.\n\"We are disappointed,\" a spokesman told USA Today when the government and UN objected to North Korean actions.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, there is still something we can take inspiration from. The fact that romantic poems represent the poets\u2019 understanding of romance has left many seekers mesmerised and intrigued. Most importantly, however, there are ways of taking inspiration from these sentiments.\nIt is possible to say about a romantic poem that it talks about how heartache makes love better. In the year 1595, Thomas Norton once made an ironic poem called Manners should be Learned. He wrote a dialogue about how the people would be saying right and wrong but people will just follow the norms and trends of other people.",

Originally this was going to be a burrito post. But for the life of me I could not get a good photo of all the different components wrapped up in the tortilla. It didn\u2019t look appetizing at all! Ah the woes of food photography. And really, I don\u2019t know why I was so fixated on making this a burrito anyway, that\u2019s going to be horribly out of date in the matter of minutes.\nFirst, I\u2019ve got some pretty cool kitchen goods. They all look very cute, don\u2019t you think?\nRaven Valley has it all: microwaveable plastic bowls, mixing bowls and slicers. Ok, what\u2019s the heck I\u2019m going to put them to use? We\u2019ll see\u2026 If you read about anything else with Raven Valley, you\u2019ll notice the unit names\u2026 It\u2019s pretty ridiculous. Yeah, I know! but do me a favor: don\u2019t think about my words\u2026 Unless you want me to tell you they\u2019re duds. Remember",

  "The WH golf team improved their record to an overall 7-9 today with their impressive win over Quincy 228-276. The Panthers needed today's win to keep their state tournament berth chances alive and need to win their final two matches tomorrow and Thursday to make it a reality.\nThe team played extremely well with their top six scores 5 over or better. Sophomore Nolan Warren led the charge for the Panthers with an impressive 2 over par 36 at Ridder Farm Golf Club. Junior captain Shane Devlin wasn't far behind with a 3 over 37, and senior Mike Capellupo finished strong with a 5 over 39. The team posted a winning score on today's game but like most golf teams will be reliant on senior hitters to carry the team over tough obstacles that they throw down on the golf course. Our senior (Mr. Churchill!) had three of the best drives in the last 10 holes for all 36 frames. Cap, Dev and Nolan pulled up right in the corner of the par 4 second hole and with strong back half drives they delivered first and last hole pars to start their first round. Devlin opened up with a great hole shot on second, running it 160' by holding it and striking good length",
