  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, the structure of their vertebrae is not fixed and can be different from that of modern tetrapods , even when using the same terminology . For instance, the structure of temnospondyl (rhachitomous) vertebrae is similar to that of dorsal vertebrae in basal carnivorous tetrapods (e.g., salamanders, lizards, and crocodilians ), but differ from those of aquatic tetrapods (e.g., frog-like amphibians, birds, and reptiles ). 2",
