  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be of any assistance at Kinburn, the only active combat between the two countries until WW1. The Russian navy lost almost all of its steam batteries during the Crimean War, and never deployed more than four in combat, with three serving at Suvorov Bay during the battles of Evert and Sinope. The former was used at a distance from the fighting to bombard the shore defenses, the latter by the Russian Battlefleet.",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Mississippian period.\nTheir osteology suggests that edopoids were more agile in flight and swimming than their subsequent sisters from the sister clade Amynthoidamorphida. As an outgroup to amynthoidamorphs, these basal temnospondyls are very similar to the Plesiostongyllidae, which are characterized by a very small eye socket, and can also be considered edopoids.\nThe first complete edopoid skull ever discovered was found in Argentina in the Late Carboniferous, and later described by Alfred Mercier as Edops rivularis.

Ever noticed the oil spots that sometimes form in your chicken-noodle soup? Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in it. Add a drop of vegetable oil. Record the color you get. See what happens.\nIf you were to attempt this experiment you might think the oil was just floating on top of the water. But if you do this with plain water and oil, it doesn\u2019t turn out quite as you might expect. The oil does not just float on top of the water. Rather, the oil forms a flat layer on top of the water and mixes with it. This shows that the two liquids don\u2019t mix and what appears to be the oil simply floating on top of the water is in fact the oil mixing with the water.",

The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can nonetheless use some words to describe the emotions of love.\nLet's start with Romeo and Juliet. In this heart-wrenching love story, Shakespeare describes one of the most agonizing human emotions. \"O brave new world that has such people in't!\" \u2013 These words have inspired poets from the Elizabethan era to present time. It is one of the most powerful love poems ever written.

He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as \" an exemplar of the humanity that destroyed the American slaver \". I was struck by the sentence \" there was something about Lieber that was so frightening... that is brought out... \" Rosenfeld concluded that because \" life has taught me so much about people \", and that I \" learn something very sharply from the true horror of life \", I will never again write a book in such a dramatic way, focusing on the topic \" one way or another \".
