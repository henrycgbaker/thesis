  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in the Crimean War. Their role was to protect the main steam fleet from enemy fire. The battle of Kinburn was a major victory for the French. The Crimean War was a European war fought in the Black Sea. The war started in September 1853 when the Russian fleet attacked a British fleet in the Baltic Sea. The Russian fleet was forced to retreat to the Black Sea. The war continued until 1856.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylic vertebrae is not as clear as it is for the two other major classes of tetrapod vertebrae. The two basic forms of tetrapod vertebrae are rhachitomous and stereospondylic. The rhachitomous form is found in the earliest tetrapods, and the stereospondylic form is found in the most advanced tetrapods. The rhachitomous form is the one that has been most extensively studied, and has been most helpful in our understanding of the early evolution of tetrapods. The rhachitomous form has a number of different characteristics.",
