They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in 1856 to be used in the Crimean War.

Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe, and why.
