  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, most temnospondyls are basal or intermediately placed within the Stereospondyli , with few exceptions . As such, the adaptation of temnospondyls is interpreted to reflect a rapid diversification , probably occurring prior to the extinction of the entire group , about 50 to 55 million years ago. Few outcrops survive of the temnospondyl tetrapods , hence comparative studies are based on fossils and comparisons between specimens of known generic and specific identities .
