  "Can you explain the concept of context switching in the Linux process scheduling? \n\nAnswer:\n\nContext switching is the process of switching between different tasks or processes in a Linux operating system. It is a critical aspect of the operating system, as it allows the system to manage multiple tasks simultaneously, ensuring that the system runs smoothly and efficiently.\n\nIn Linux, context switching occurs when a process is suspended and then resumed. This is done by the kernel, which saves the current state of the process (including its memory, registers, and other resources) and transfers control to the next process.\n\nThe kernel then performs the necessary actions to switch the process to the new task",
