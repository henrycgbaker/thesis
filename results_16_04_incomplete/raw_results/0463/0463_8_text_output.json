  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in the Crimean War. They were used during the Italian war at the start of the First World War by the British to destroy German fortifications on the shores of the Adriatic. In World War 1, the French, British, Dutch, Norwegian, German and Italian navies used their movable batteries to bombard ships and shore defenses from the top of wooden battering rafts. This method of warfare is called raider warfare. The nature of the First World War made it impossible for the British to use their floating batteries in a sustained manner in 1915. They were not used in action until 1916.",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondyli is not clear, since some rhachitomous forms have paraxial vertebrae, while all the tetrapod ones have latero - axial vertebrae. With the addition of ossification of the pelvic girdle, the major difference between the two groups becomes rather clear. The rhachitomous temnospondyls did not have a pelvic girdle. On the other hand, some of the stereospondyli had latero - axial vertebrae. Therefore, the so-called rhachitomous temnospondyls are actually not different from the stereospondyli,",
