Against the backdrop of the Mayan calendar, this book explores the human condition and the power of beliefs to shape our lives.\n\"Right Between Your Ears is a powerful and thought-provoking book that explores the human condition in a way that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The author's own journey is a fascinating one, and her personal experiences are shared with the reader in a way that is both humorous and poignant. The book is a must-read for anyone who has ever struggled with beliefs and the power of human perception.\"\n\"Right Between Your Ears",
