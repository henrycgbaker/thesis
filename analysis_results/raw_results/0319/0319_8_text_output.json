  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover the presence of very simple, point-like vertebrae in temnospondyls is not so unique that they all descend from a common origin . Graves agrees that tight taxa and a number of syngenetic relationships make it hard to pin down the origin, perhaps forking there along the Arecibos line . It is possible that the temnospondyls were more widely distributed than many critics believe, and were present in most continents .\nWhat would eventually result in the suborder Stereospondyli or the growing complexity in the Vertebrae of temnospondyls (R",
