  "Can you explain the concept of context switching in the Linux process scheduling? \n\nA: Context switching refers to the process of switching between different tasks (contexts) in a process. In the Linux process scheduling, context switching is achieved by using a scheduler that decides which task to execute next based on the current state of the system and the resources available. This is done by monitoring the CPU usage and other system metrics, and selecting the task that has the lowest priority (i.e. The task with the least amount of work to do).\n\nFor example, when the system is idle, the scheduler may choose to switch to a low-priority task that is waiting for",
