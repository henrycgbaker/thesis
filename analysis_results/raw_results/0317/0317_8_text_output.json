If the shape of the otic region was in fact more dorsoventral than it is today, this might suggest that the ancestor of temnospondyls and frogs had a dorsoventral stapes , rather than a laterally dorsoventral one . Thus, the tympanic membrane of temnospondyls and frogs evolved by combining an earlier dorsoventral stapes with an early dorsoventral otic cavity .

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244 , literally \" Ironclad \" , later renamed Azuma \u6771 , \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869 , which marked the end of the Boshin War , and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration . The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards , first ironclads and later armored cruisers and battleships , as part of the larger effort to improve its navy. The Imperial Navy underwent a gradual shift from wooden-hulled steamships to ironclads, which was largely accomplished through careful management of resources and the development of efficient, maneuverable designs. These first naval vessels were usually built with simple, expensive wooden designs that were difficult to maintain and had limited maneuverability.

  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover , this condition is present in the basal eury- and hypercarnivorous archosaurs and the latter group includes vertebrates that are well known for their low vertebral morphology .
