  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, there are many tetrapods, including many higher vertebrates , with tetrapod-like carena ( a form of thick tail) . It has been suggested that the therapsid condition of haggle ( the thin tuft of the limbs with a smaller node) is also present in temnospondyls. This phylogenetic connection between temnospondyls and the tetrapod limbs suggests that temnospondyl limbs evolved from tetrapod-like forms in the Devonian , by a process of incremental evolution , that ultimately led to the",
