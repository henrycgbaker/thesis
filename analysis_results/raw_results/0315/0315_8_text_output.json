However, the scheduler mitigated this issue by identifying the current context and scheduling the process accordingly. When a process terminates, the kernel requests the CPU back to the next context that is expected to perform better.\nFor instance, a process running under the user context will be scheduled behind a running process under the system context. This process can potentially cause a bottleneck in the system resource usage as the system keeps the user process idle by scheduling it",

  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, the morphological structure of temnospondyls is highly variable, and several species are characterized by a narrow neck , small head , elongated tail , and broadly ribbon-like bodies . In some temnospondyls , the neck and tail are reduced or absent, and the vertebrae have numerous separate elements . The relationships of temnospondyls to other vertebrates is currently being reevaluated . Several tetrapod orders are being redefined in light of the findings of phylogenetics .",
