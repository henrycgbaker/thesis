With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, the vertebrae of temnospondyls are often simpler than those of modern tetrapods , and some temnospondyls have a reduced number of vertebrae , as well as a reduced number of ribs .
