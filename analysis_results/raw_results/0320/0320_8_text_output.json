  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover , numerous temnospondyl forms have undergone significant modifications, suggesting that a mixture of rhachitomous and non-rhachitomous traits were often combined in the intermediate phylogeny of temnospondyls . The same trait was also exhibited by some unrelated forms . The series of elongated sarcopterygian vertebrae can be represented by various species.
