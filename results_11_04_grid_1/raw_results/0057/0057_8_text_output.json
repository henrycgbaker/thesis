  " The first ocean @-@ going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors , and these features were only gradually abandoned . Early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry \" 5 to 9 days coal \" , and the situation was similar with the early ironclads . Warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail ( though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle ) , and a telescopic funnel which allowed her to switch from running water to electric current for on-the-spot calibration .  Because of their excellent propulsion-sail ratio ( she had twice as much sail as steam engine ), the ironclads underdrew the warship sails much less ; this greatly reduced the danger from engagement. When steel ships defeated wooden ships, however, the experience led to warships being constructed out of iron or steel ; the greater efficiency of the steamer at underdraft meant that this was feasible with both. The steam engine had the advantage of allowing a faster-moving craft to achieve greater range by letting",
