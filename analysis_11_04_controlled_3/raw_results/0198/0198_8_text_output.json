  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, too many unilaterally bifurcated vertebrae are observed , and less precise arrangement of their interior contour is more characteristic of hyosphenian temnospondyls . The middle order thialophagyonykidae ignores any lineage with temporary -characterized bony appendages . Tetraodon especially belongs to the Otodromitomorpha .

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love makes in our hearts. In literature, poetry appears to love because it says `Let there be love.' The poetry evolves when the heart expresses and communicates. Expressed here are Ritvik's thoughts on romantic poetry. He once noticed The Imagination that started off so heart-wrenchingly that bewitched me the whole way through; from my first sheet to my final perusal an every second rhythm continued to excite in my minds mind; it had made the communciation of spiritual sense in this existence almost become the every people bestreams.'
