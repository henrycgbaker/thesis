  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover , the presence of segments having structures characteristic of ganoid fish and gnathostomulids , and clade characterized by skull shape and articulation similar to that of archosaurs , are also important clades that have not all been assigned to suborders by current studies . This diagram of classification of temnospondyls , published by Davenport (2002), highlights this concept.

The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love evokes. They capture the love\u2019s sublime grandeur that moves us to our hearts. Poetry expresses emotion. The poet does so by letting his or her heart lead the way. A poet\u2019s heart needs to have passion and affection. These make the poem breathe, bringing a vitality that moves the reader to a spiritual state. In our view, the romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions.
