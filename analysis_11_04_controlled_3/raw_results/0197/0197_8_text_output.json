  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea . Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features , including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls . Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae . Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea , and is the oldest known temnospondyl family . Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species , having been present at the end-Triassic Hartprung  Formation .\n\nVertebrates \nThe Edopoids were large herbivorous temnospondyls, the largest edopoids reaching lengths of up to 5 m. They had wide, arching pelvises and simple, rotund dentaries. Both species were diploblastic , meaning they have both a hard outer coating, and a specialized growth cavity that contained blood vessels. Dorsal teeth had up to 14 teeth, some of which could have been cuspidated . Edops probably used",

  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, the phylogenetic relationships of many temnospondyls are not well understood , and are open to modification by other criteria. It seems that a generic classification would need to define the crumpled vertebrae as being the defining feature, and other members of the order having somewhat simpler dentition than Cryptospondyli. I suspect that someday someday a specific definition will become clear, and a broadly accepted application of this new grouping and species names will likely occur . Recent time .
