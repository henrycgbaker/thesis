  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, the morphology of the vertebrae of temnospondyls differs from that of other temnospondyls , suggesting that a common ancestor of temnospondyls and other temnospondyls may have had a more complex structure than previously thought . This alternative classification is based on the morphology of the vertebrae , and is not necessarily based on the presence or absence of specific elements in the vertebrae . This new classification allows for a more comprehensive study of temnospondyl evolution and provides a more accurate estimate of the timing of temnospondyl evolution.",
