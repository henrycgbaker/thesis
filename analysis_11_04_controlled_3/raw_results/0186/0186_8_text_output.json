Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, the simpler forms of temnospondyls are found in a wide range of tetrapod groups, from the earliest tetrapods (the Ediacaran , the Cambrian , and the Ordovician ) to the most recent tetrapods (the latest Eocene and the earliest Oligocene ).
