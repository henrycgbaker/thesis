  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, all temnospondyls are closely related to each other , and their ancestral condition is probably not special . The most significant differences among temnospondyls relate to the arrangement of their vertebrae , the placement of the vertebrae within the spinal column , and the number of body regions that they possess.
