  " Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover, several reptile lineages, such as the dinosaurs , were predators and presumably have phylogenetically adapted forms. Further advancement in understanding of systematics will help pin down the major suborders, mesohostrian, and rhachitomous temnospondyls . Two placental mammal groups, great apes (called the Panidae) and the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), are amongst the most common animals known to science.

But are we right? Is there an \"end\" to our particular story? Should we give up hoping that 2012 will be the year, that the world will change and end on May 21?

It could be a poet who finds inspiration in nature, who's inspired by the beauty of a moonlit night, or someone who chooses love over any other emotion. Love is a raw and deep emotion that flows through our veins and is something that romantic poets tap into.\n- To quote another poem titled, \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" by T.S.
